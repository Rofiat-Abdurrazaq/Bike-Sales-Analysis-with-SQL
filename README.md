# Bike-Sales-Analysis-with-SQL

Data Analysis (SQL) Project 1: Bikes Sales Analysis
INTRODUCTION
In today’s data-driven business world, understanding customer behavior and profitability is critical to strategic decision-making. The goal of the project is to analyze bike sales data with Microsoft SQL Server by exploring how customer demographics impact the profitability of different product categories, identifying correlations between these factors and overall sales performance, and how businesses can optimize marketing, product development, and pricing strategies by better understanding these relationships.
The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from Kaggle, it contains 113,036  transactions with details about the products purchased, the customer demographics (age group, gender, country), the cost and price of each product, and the total revenue and profit generated. This dataset offers a broad perspective on how different segments of customers contribute to product profitability across different regions.


PREPARING DATA FOR ANALYSIS
The Comma Separated Value (CSV) file is to be imported into the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (MSSQL) for analysis. Firstly, a database was created (Sales_data) before importing the bike sales CSV file as a table and declaring the data type for each column data.

 DATA ANALYSIS
1.	Table Data Overview: The query and result provide a snapshot of the table's contents, which includes 18 columns and 111,036 rows of sales data spanning 6 years (2011-2016). The data covers transactions from six countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, United States, and the United Kingdom) and focuses on three main product categories: Accessories, Bikes, and Clothing.

2.	Profitable product: The bikes category is the most profitable segment, generating a total revenue of $61,782,134. This highlights that made the core focus of this project on bikes sales, as they drive the majority of sales. To further capitalize on this success, the company could enhance its bike offerings, introduce new models, and optimize marketing strategies aimed at bike buyers. Additionally, bundling marketing for accessories and clothing with bike purchases could help boost revenue in these lower-performing segments.

3.	Marketing Insights: Based on the dataset, I was able to deduce that adult segment between ages 35-64, particularly females constitute the largest customer base. Followed by the Young Adults segments between ages 25-34 which show significant potential. This suggests that the bike business should prioritize marketing and product offerings for the adult segments, emphasizing high-end bikes suitable for fitness, commuting, or recreation. Additionally, targeting young adult segments with versatile and affordable bike models could increase sales. Lastly, promotional efforts can be aimed at youth (<25) could build brand loyalty, especially among emerging cyclists.

4.	Geographical Profit Insights and Growth Opportunities: The result below indicates that the United States is the most profitable market, contributing $6.8 million in total profit, followed by Australia and the United Kingdom. These regions represent key revenue drivers for the business, suggesting that efforts should focus on maintaining and expanding market share in these countries. Additionally, while Germany, France, and Canada are profitable, they lag behind the top three, highlighting opportunities for growth through targeted marketing, expanding dealer networks, and introducing new products to strengthen the business presence in these regions.

RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSION 
This bike sales analysis reveals key insights into the business's revenue and profitability across different regions and customer segments. 
•	The company can focus on targeted marketing for bikes for young adults and adults, while upselling accessories and clothing through bundle deals in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom represent the most profitable markets. Seasonal discounts and promotions can drive sales during peak periods, and expanding product variants, such as introducing electric or foldable bikes which can attract new customers. Enhancing customer loyalty programs and leveraging positive reviews will also help in customer retention and build trust with new buyers. 
•	Germany, France, and Canada offer promising opportunities for further expansion. The company should revamp product positioning to better highlight unique features, gather customer feedback to provide insights into improvements, while increasing product visibility in both physical and online stores will attract more attention in these regions. Additionally, focusing on niche markets or specific customer segments can help tap into new audiences. These strategies will help improve sales and overall product performance. By focusing on high-performing markets and customer segments, the business can drive growth, increase market share, and sustain profitability in the competitive global bike industry.
